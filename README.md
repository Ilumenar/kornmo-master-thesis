# kornmo-master-thesis
Todo list for the repository:
- [ ] Remove the Frost API key
- [ ] Specify a more universal Frost API path for file storage
- [ ] Write more specifically what the Frost API code does


## Frost API
The Frost API source code located under "src/frost" is a fork from a previous project in KORNMO, located here: 
https://github.com/putetrekk/kornmo/tree/master/frost.
The code was used to download and process precipitation and temperature for 2017-2021.
It was further expanded to download and process day degrees for all recordings above 0 and above 5.
